Hello. My name is Ran Elgedawy. I'm a first year PhD student here at UTK. Prior to that I was a PhD student at the University of Central Florida.
I'm excited to take this class because I know that dealing with data is the first and one of the most critical steps in any machine learning or deep learning problem.
